# Solar LLM based C to Assembly:
A Tool for Converting C to Assembly using Solar LLM

## Why Convert C to Assembly?

### Performance Optimization
- Identifies inefficient code paths and unnecessary instructions.

### Debugging and Troubleshooting
- Detects issues not evident in high-level code.

### Security Analysis
- Finds security vulnerabilities.

### Embedded Systems
- Ensures efficient use of limited resources.

### Education
- Understanding the translation of high-level code to machine instructions.

## Why Use Solar LLM for C to Assembly Tasks?

### Versatility in IoT Systems
- Deals with different architectures and environments efficiently.

### Time and Energy Efficiency
- Preparing the environment manually is a time and energy-consuming process.

### Unified Tool
- Solar LLM can be a single solution for all architectures and environments.

## Features of Solar LLM

- **Specialized for C to Assembly Conversion:** Specifically designed to handle C to Assembly translation tasks.
- **Architecture Selection:** Prompts the user to select the intended architecture.
- **File Format:** Saves the assembly file in `.S` format.
- **Simulation:** Simulates the output of the code.

## Usage

1. **Input the C Code:** Provide the C code that needs to be converted.
2. **Select Architecture:** Choose the target architecture for the assembly code.
3. **Conversion:** Solar LLM converts the C code to assembly language.
4. **Output:** The assembly file is saved in `.S` format.
5. **Simulation:** The tool simulates the output of the assembly code.
