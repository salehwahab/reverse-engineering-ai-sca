Deep Learning-based Reverse Engineering via Side Channel Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the code, datasets, and experimental setup for the PhD thesis project:  
**"Pseudo-labeling for Deep Learning-based Side-channel Disassembly Using Contextual Layer and Feature Engineering"**

The study proposes a multi-phase framework for advanced side-channel based disassembly and dummy instruction detection using deep learning, feature engineering, and contextual sequence modeling.

## Research Objectives

- Develop a **pseudo-labeling** model to estimate power traces from assembly code.
- Create a **disassembly** model using engineered features and contextual models.
- Implement a **dummy instruction detection** model using sequence labeling.

## Methodology Summary

1. **Dataset Creation**
   - Real cryptographic implementations (AES, RSA, DES, etc.)
   - Power traces generated via Signed Hamming Distance model
   - Total: 1.76 million samples, 24 instruction classes

2. **Pseudo-labeling**
   - GRU-based model with context embeddings and temporal attention
   - Outputs estimated power traces for unlabeled instruction sequences

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Moving average, autocorrelation, and MLTI (Moving Log-transformed Temporal Interaction)

4. **Dummy Detection**
   - LSTM-based sequence labeling with token embedding
   - Detects obfuscation techniques like inserted dummy instructions

---

## Key Results

- Power Estimation (RÂ² = 0.9963)
- Disassembly Accuracy: High with MLTI + window size = 15
- Dummy Detection Accuracy: 97.9% with LSTM
