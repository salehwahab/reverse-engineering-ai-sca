## Overview
**"Pseudo-labeling for Deep Learning-based Side-channel Disassembly Using Contextual Layer and Feature Engineering"**

The project proposes a multi-phase framework for advanced side-channel based disassembly and dummy instruction detection using deep learning, feature engineering, and contextual sequence modeling.

---

## Objectives

- Develop a **pseudo-labeling** model to estimate power traces from assembly code.
- Create a **disassembly** model using engineered features and contextual models.
- Implement a **dummy instruction detection** model using sequence labeling.

---

## System Summary

1. **Dataset Creation**
   - Real cryptographic implementations (AES, RSA, DES, etc.)
   - Power traces generated via Signed Hamming Distance model
   - Total: 1.76 million samples, 24 instruction classes

2. **Leakage Modeling**
   - Side channel leakage modeling using a sequential model.
   - Leveraging contextual and embedding layers for accurate power leakage prediction.

4. **Pseudo-labeling**
   - GRU-based model with context embeddings and temporal attention
   - Outputs estimated power traces for unlabeled instruction sequences

5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Moving average, autocorrelation, and MLTI (Moving Log-transformed Temporal Interaction)

6. **Dummy Detection**
   - LSTM-based sequence labeling with token embedding
   - Detects obfuscation techniques like inserted dummy instructions
   
7. **LLM for Assembly to C**
   - After recovering the Assembly language, an LLM is used for converting it to human-readable C code

8. **Side Channel Forensics**
   - Using electromagnetic emission for wirelessly identifying a device's activities

- Disassembly Accuracy: High with MLTI + window size = 15
- Dummy Detection Accuracy: 97.9% with LSTM
